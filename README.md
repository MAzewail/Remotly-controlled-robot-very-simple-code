# Remotly-controlled-robot-very-simple-code
Very simple code for remotely controlling a 2DW robot using HC-05 or HC-06 Bluetooth model and an Arduino board.


## This code is very simple and does not rely on switch cases or even a chain of if and else if; nevertheless, there are only two lines of code in the main function without any functions or external libraries.
